# Become an Expert Literary Writer

# Are you the next Stephen King? or the next Agatha Christie?

## Summary
Master Writer is an artificial intelligence tool that aims to process specific texts of a writer to learn the differential characteristics of their style and replicate it effectively. It addresses the problem of the lack of distinctive personality in the writing generated by natural language processing models that use overly broad and unspecific datasets. The idea is to utilize individual works of known authors to enhance literary quality and help other writers find their own creative voice. However, the importance of supervising its use to prevent issues like text forgery or plagiarism is emphasized.
## Core Idea
Master Writer is an artificial intelligence tool that aims to process specific texts of a writer to learn the differential characteristics of their style and replicate it effectively.

## Specific Problem Addressed
Existing NLP models often use overly broad and unspecific datasets for literary creation, resulting in written expression that lacks the distinctive personality that characterizes each author's writing. Master Writer addresses this problem by focusing on individual author works to understand and incorporate their unique style into the writing process.

## Data and AI Techniques
The proposed model will be trained exclusively with the individual work of an author, such as Stephen King or Agatha Christie. It should be able to read original texts in various formats (e.g., docx, pdf, txt, epub, azw) and detect common patterns in plot, structure, setting, characters, dialogues, expressions, idioms, grammar, language, and other elements that define the work of each writer. The ideal outcome is for the model to write a story indistinguishable in technique and style from an original work produced by its author after sufficient training.

## How It Should Be Used
The purpose of Master Writer should be strictly educational and used as a tool to enhance one's own creativity. For instance, it could rewrite a text in the style of Stephen King or provide a version in the style of Agatha Christie, offering examples, pointing out differences, and providing practical advice to novice writers to improve their craft and develop their own unique style.

## Challenges
Using Master Writer requires vigilance, as any tool can be misused. Some users might be tempted to falsely attribute texts to known writers, plagiarize whole sections, or limit their creativity due to lack of confidence. To address this, it is crucial for Master Writer to be initially supervised by a human teacher who can guide students on its scope and limitations, ensuring responsible and ethical usage.

## Development
Master Writer is currently at the conceptual stage, but with the current state of NLP models, its development and implementation seem feasible. I invite developers to contribute their expertise and insights to make this idea a reality. Considering its potential impact, I believe it would be widely accepted commercially, and I am personally eager to be the first client!

## Thanks
I would like to express my gratitude to the University of Helsinki for providing free courses on "Elements of AI" and "Building AI," along with all other disseminators of knowledge in this field. Their efforts in making AI education accessible have contributed to a more informed and productive world.
